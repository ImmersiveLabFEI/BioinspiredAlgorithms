# BioInspiredAlgorithmsComparison
Comparison of bio-inspired algorithms for medical image segmentation using Tsallis entropy on the BRATS dataset (years 2017 and 2018) using MATLAB.
The main file for this experiment is "start.m". Each algorithm is executed through the "execute_algorithm.m" file. 
Also, each algorithm may be executed independently for any kind of image. Follow the instructions in the header of each algorithm file to get to know better about the parameters considered.
